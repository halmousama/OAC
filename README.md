# OAC: Organizational Artificial Consciousness

**OAC is a theoretical framework and a future-looking blueprint for designing next-generation AI systems. It moves beyond monolithic models by proposing a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where small, specialized AI "agents" are coordinated by a central "manager" to solve complex problems.**

The core philosophy of OAC is the complete **separation of the reasoning engine from the knowledge base**. Instead of building massive models that "know" everything, we aim to build smaller, more efficient "reasoning" models that are masters of thinking, planning, and learning, and that access a vast, external, and updatable knowledge library.

This repository contains the detailed documentation, papers, and (eventually) proof-of-concept implementations related to the OAC framework.

### Core Principles
- **Hierarchical Structure:** A "manager" agent delegates tasks to specialized "executor" agents.
- **Decoupled Memory:** An external, multi-layered memory ecosystem serves as the single source of truth.
- **Standardized Communication:** Agents communicate via a formal protocol like [A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)](https://a2a-protocol.org/).
- **Continuous Evolution:** The system learns and improves over time through reinforcement learning and self-reflection.
